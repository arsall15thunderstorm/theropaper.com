            <h2>Spotify enters the Roblox Metaverse</h2>
            <h3>First Music streaming service to do so!</h3>
                <p>Spotify announced today it will become the first music streaming brand to have an official presence within Roblox, with the launch of “Spotify Island,” a place where artists and fans will gather to play interactive quests, unlock exclusive content and buy artist merchandise.<br>

                    The new Spotify Island destination in Roblox will actually consist of a central mainland surrounded by a collection of themed islands, which players can explore and interact with by walking, running, jumping, and touching and picking up various objects. <br>The worlds themselves feature a color palette centered around Spotify’s shades of greens, with oranges and purples mixed in.
                    
                    There’s also a musical play box in the top right corner of the world, which will feature a soundtrack powered by Soundtrap, one of Spotify’s audio creation tools. The music here can be played or paused, or players can skip tracks, the company says.</p>
